# Transport & Delivery Tracker (SQL-Only Project)

## Description

This project simulates a transport and logistics company database, using only SQL. It contains all the necessary tables to manage a fleet of trucks, drivers, delivery routes, fuel prices, and completed deliveries. The goal is to demonstrate SQL proficiency in creating and querying relational databases for real-world business scenarios.



## Technologies Used

- SQL 

## Project Structure

- `create_tables.sql`: Defines the database schema with foreign key constraints.
- `insert_data.sql`: Populates the database with example data (trucks, drivers, routes, deliveries, fuel prices).
- `queries.sql`: Contains various SQL queries for analysis and reporting.

## Database Schema

The project includes the following tables:
- `Trucks` – stores truck information (model, fuel consumption, engine, year)
- `Drivers` – stores driver information (name, experience, license type)
- `Routes` – stores delivery routes (origin, destination, distance)
- `Deliveries` – links trucks, drivers, and routes with date, profit, and fuel used
- `FuelPrices` – stores fuel price history by date

## SQL Concepts Demonstrated

- `CREATE TABLE` with primary and foreign keys
- `INSERT INTO` with sample business data
- `JOIN` between multiple tables
- `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, `SUM()`, `MAX()`, `AVG()`, `LIMIT`
- Simple business intelligence queries (profit per driver, fuel consumption per truck, etc.)

## How to Use

1. Create a new database using SQLite or your preferred SQL engine.
2. Run `create_tables.sql` to initialize the schema.
3. Run `insert_data.sql` to populate the tables.
4. Run `queries.sql` to execute analytical queries.
